    Tim Berners-Lee (also known as “TimBL”) was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England. His parents are mathematicians,
    Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods.  He is best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web but he has also been the first person to 
    successfully implement communication between a host server and a Hypertext Transfer Protocol client through the internet sometime in 
    November of 1989. He was working at CERN (a large particle physics laboratory near Geneva Switzerland) as a software engineer. 
    His ultimate vision was to see millions of computers connected across the world though a single universal system rather than sharing 
    results via mail or very specific communication systems. For example, the Internet was originally developed by the United States military
     during the Cold War as a new form of communication but was only thought of as a form of communication within the United States. 
     To practically everyone else on the planet, the Internet was useless to them until the World Wide Web was created. 

     Development of the World Wide Web After conceiving the idea of what will soon be the World Wide Web, he wrote a program known as ENQUIRE.
      This will soon be the backbone of the World Wide Web. ENQUIRE served three main functions. 1) It acts as a personal database. 2)
       Its acts as a software model. 3) It acts as a way to play with hypertext however, each new page needed to be linked to an existing page.
        At first, the idea of ENQUIRE did not pick up a lot of interest. Berners-Lees boss told him to try to implement it into a new NeXT
         workstation. Berners-Lee considered several names for the final product but eventually picked World Wide Web
